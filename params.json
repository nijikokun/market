Market should be readable.\r\n  2. Each feature should have no ties to other features unless they are directly related such as links.\r\n  3. No optional flexibility, each feature must have a reason to exist and optional existance complicates that.\r\n  4. Each feature should be able to be turned on or off.\r\n\r\n## Plugins\r\n\r\n  Market should be a core with the possibility of add-ons, as such there are add, remove functions to allow others to modify and change the language as they see fit and contribute back if wanted or you can make it your own if wished.\r\n\r\n## The Core Language\r\n\r\n  Market once again to iterate quickly, is refined, simple, and very strict to it's core.\r\n\r\n### Newlines\r\n\r\n  Double space will cause the section or content to be wrapped in paragraph tags `<p>` and `</p>`.\r\n\r\n##### Rules\r\n\r\n  1. Excess whitespace must be stripped.\r\n  2. Excess newlines must be stripped before appending the ending tag.\r\n\r\n### Emphasis\r\n\r\n  Market treats emphasis differently than markdown, there are to seperate ways to emphasis and this is bold and italics, as such they have different connentations in the human langauge and should be treated as such through text for readability and for a direct and clear understanding without need for a second look.\r\n\r\n##### Rules\r\n\r\n  1. Must be surrounded by either a space, single character, or word to be converted.\r\n  2. Should not intefere with links, or code, thus those should be converted and stored first, then replaced later.\r\n\r\n#### Bold\r\n\r\n  Text wrapped with asterisks (*) is implied as important and will be wrapped with an HTML `<strong>` tag:\r\n\r\n  ```market\r\n  This *is* readable.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  would produce:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  This <strong>is</strong> readable.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Italics\r\n\r\n  Text wrapped with the forward slash (/) character will be replaced with an HTML `<em>` tag:\r\n\r\n  ```market\r\n  Hello /World/!\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  would produce:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  Hello <em>World</em>!\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Underlined\r\n\r\n  Text wrapped with the low-dash (_) will be raplaced with an HTML `<u>` tag:\r\n\r\n  ```market\r\n  I think you _should_ be able to understand what I am trying to convey.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  would produce:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  I think you <u>should</u> be able to understand what I am trying to convey.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\n  Market only supports inline-code in it's core specification.\r\n\r\n  Text wrapped with back-ticks (`) will be converted, stored, and replaced later as inline code:\r\n\r\n  ```market\r\n  Hello to use market at its base: `market(source, options)`\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  will produce:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  Hello to use market at it's base: <code>market(source, options)</code>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## The Plugin Language\r\n\r\n  Market seperates it's core from it's more verbose features such as lists, links, and so forth.\r\n\r\n### Lists\r\n\r\n  Unlike markdown which allows for a variety of flexibility market is more refined and only allows two types of lists and markup for them to keep consistency.\r\n\r\n  These are all future functionality, and prone to change as they have not yet been written.\r\n\r\n#### Un-ordered\r\n\r\n  Text with leading dashes (-) are considered un-ordered lists, the reason we don't use asterisks and I would love to include that functionality is because it would go against the core philosophies of market as they are already used for more meaningful elements.\r\n\r\n  ```market\r\n  Grocery List:\r\n\r\n  - Dairy\r\n  -- Milk\r\n  -- Butter\r\n  -- Eggs\r\n  - Veggies\r\n  -- Broccoli\r\n  -- Carrots\r\n  -- Lettuce\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  would produce:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  Grocery List:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Dairy\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Milk</li>\r\n        <li>Butter</li>\r\n        <li>Eggs</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Veggies\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Broccoli</li>\r\n        <li>Carrots</li>\r\n        <li>Lettuce</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Ordered\r\n\r\n  Market utilizes the same paradigm as markdown for ordered lists ([A-Z0-9].)\r\n\r\n  ```market\r\n  Things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Make market specification\r\n  2. Write out lexer\r\n  3. Release\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  would produce:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  Things to do:\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>Make market specification</li>\r\n    <li>Write out lexer</li>\r\n    <li>Release</li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Github Features\r\n\r\n  Market in it's core used to support github issues, commits, gist referencing, and more.\r\n\r\n  Now they've been put into the plugins section.\r\n\r\n#### Issue Referencing\r\n\r\n  Referencing github issues is a very basic syntax of `ghi:[Github Name]/[Github Repository]:[Issue Number]`\r\n\r\n  ```market\r\n  Hello on ghi:Nijikokun/market:83, I see you closed and commited, why?\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  would produce:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  Hello on issue <a href=\"http://github.com/Nijikokun/market/issues/83\">#83</a>, I see you closed and commited, why?\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n##### Multiple Issue References\r\n\r\n  ```market\r\n  ghi:[Github Name]/[Github Repository]:[Number],[Number]...\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  would produce:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  issues <a href=\"#\">#n</a>, <a href=\"#\">#n</a>...\r\n  ```","google":""}
